<h1>Ferryman app</h1>

Application created to solve logistic problem which is: Middleman (wrongly translated by me as ferryman).
Problem is to find maximum profit for broker/middleman. Variables are: Cost of transport on a road, cost of buing, cost of selling, demand and supply.
We get: maximum profit and how our roads should look like to achive maximum profit
