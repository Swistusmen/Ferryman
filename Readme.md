<h1>Ferryman app</h1>

Application created to solve logistic problem which is: Middleman (wrongly translated by me as ferryman).
Problem is to find maximum profit for broker/middleman. 

Variables are: 

-Cost of transport on a road

-cost of buing

-cost of selling

-demand

-supply

We get: 

-maximum profit

-merch on every road to get maximum profit
